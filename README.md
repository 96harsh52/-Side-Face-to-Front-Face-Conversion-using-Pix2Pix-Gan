# Side-Face-Identification-System
 Face detection and recognition have gained widespread application in versatile fields like security, emotion detection, attendance tracking etc. But many algorithms do not work well with images of a side view of the faces. Through this project we aim to address this problem. We aim to fix the lack of front view of the face during face detection applications through CCTVs and other cameras. Apart from running face detection algorithms over images of the front view of the face, we hope to expand the effectiveness of current algorithms by using the side view of a person's face to generate a frontal image which can then be used in Face Recognition algorithms. This will then allow better recognition of people from all angles and poses than current algorithms.
